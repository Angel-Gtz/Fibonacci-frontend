## Fibonacci Calculator 

This is a project that calculates the position of a number in a fibonacci sequence, you can use 2 different calculators, the first is the one I was asked for, and the second is a calculator created based on classic style. 

To start the project run "npm start" in your terminal.

**Have fun :)**
